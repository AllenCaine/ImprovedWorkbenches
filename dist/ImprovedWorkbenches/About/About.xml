  <description>Improves 'Do until you have X' job target by letting you set quality, hitpoint and material limits for counted items, as well as ignore corpse worn apparel.

Also lets you restrict bills to a particular pawn and fine tune the "unpause at" level with buttons, the way the Enhanced Crafting mod does (as this mod is not compatible with that one).</description>
